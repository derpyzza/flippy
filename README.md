# flippy
fun little text tool

This was written as a practice project to learn reading data from the standard input.
The way it works is essentially by "flipping" each letter in a given string to it's "mirror version", with the "mirror line" being drawn right between 'm' and 'n'. So for example 'm' turns into 'n', 'l' turns into 'o', 'a' to 'z' and so on.

# Installation:
clone the repo and just run make:
```
  git clone git@github.com:derpyzza/flippy.git
  cd flippy
  mkdir bin/
  make
```
and run with:
```
  ./bin/flippy
```
